### TODO
* Interacting with the NWN engine can be at times awkward and 
  could probably be implemented better.
* Weapon Master Ki Strike
* Hook_CreatureDamageDice
* Hook_GetCreatureDamageDie
* Skills
* Saving Throws
* Damage Resist/Reduction Feedback - have to decide whether
  or not to reimplement this so that effects with damage limits
  will print properly in the combat log.
